ISSUES:
    Washer not getting a service time...


brainstorm:

OG WAY: running picks takes what hasn't been flagged as a pick. then we add it to the existing file

-- DON'T ITERATE -- ONLY RUN THE MORNING BEFORE

NEW WAY: take all of the orders each iteration. how to compare what has not changed and have what has changed remain?

right now it takes same order numbers and displays them for review. making it difficult getting to 40 plus orders

loop through batches of orders comparing model, address, notes
    
original list, if new list has same order number

    
// taglist header names
// OrderNumber	CustomerNumber	CustomerName	Salesperson	StockShipped	Description1	ShippingDate	QuantityToShip	LocationNumber	Row	Tagging	Oldest	Quantity
