Next steps:

pass in picks excel file
    - add location based on order. ( what about ones that don't pick through? )
    - add phone number 
    - add notes 

rename headers for picks file

create test files from picks file ( or use actual files... )

extra: 
    giving prompts for the updates on existing orders
    add interaction to:
        discard unneeded objects/lines
        add object/line additions
        update changes like modelnumber and location
    making an area of shop items order numbers
    formatting webpage layout
    extra: deleting 'star' items
    extra: creating drag and drop locations for files on web page
    *is there a way to format object to insert key (excel column) in between others. To format for DT upload*
    sub in DB-SHIP to replace open order and line items file

------------------------------------

ISSUES:
    Washer not getting a service time...

brainstorm

a process for DT upload intentially missing location, phone number, and notes
    - this process is to a workable point. service time is not working and will need to format with excel

a final process to combine with picks to add location, phone number, and notes
