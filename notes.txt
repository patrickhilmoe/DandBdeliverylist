Next big chunck : COMPARING AND UPDATING CHANGES TO THE LIST

making an area of shop items order numbers

make an '<li>' list of excel file on web page

loop checking for changes in all key value pairs. 
    -create new array of new objects/lines and differences in key/values ie. model updates, location updates
    -if ordernumber doesn't exist immediately add to existing list

extra: 
    add interaction to:
        discard unneeded objects/lines
        add object/line additions
        update changes like modelnumber and location
    

    
// taglist header names
// OrderNumber	CustomerNumber	CustomerName	Salesperson	StockShipped	Description1	ShippingDate	QuantityToShip	LocationNumber	Row	Tagging	Oldest	Quantity
