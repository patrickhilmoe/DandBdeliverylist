Next steps:

create a download link for converted object to excel -DONE (looks to be done)
    (original attempt was missing non-serialized items. don't know why still)

extra: deleting 'star' items
extra: creating drag and drop locations for files on web page

*is there a way to format object to insert key (excel column) in between others. To format for DT upload*

in excel:
    format columns
    delete star items

Set up another page for the converter function
add header and footer ( use example from bootcamp class)

Next big chunck : COMPARING AND UPDATING CHANGES TO THE LIST

making an area of shop items order numbers

make an '<li>' list of excel file on web page

loop checking for changes in all key value pairs. 
    -create new array of new objects/lines and differences in key/values ie. model updates, location updates
    -if ordernumber doesn't exist immediately add to existing list

extra: 
    add interaction to:
        discard unneeded objects/lines
        add object/line additions
        update changes like modelnumber and location
